# Incentivize

Building the better way to search for and post jobs utilizing a block-chain incentive based system. 

The below will be a working white paper for this project, and as such there may be changes to the information as it appears, but the general concept for this project has always been and will always be to revolutionize the way job seekers and job posters interact with eachother to create a more cohesive and efficient process.

As it stands currently, the process of finding a job in the market is absolutely one of the most frustrating endeavors that one can take on, but it's mainly a systemic problem of lack of information and communication between the two parties, and more importantly the lack of incentive for one or more of the parties involved to maintain the lines of communication throughout the entire process. 

Job posters and employers in general also face many issues with the current process with many potential candidates dropping communication, lack of qualifcations for the job, and generally wasting valuable time and resources of the company involved throughout.

We recognize however, that there is a large power disparity that we hope to reduce between the job poster and job seeker, as is apparent and will most likely be obvious, the party with a job to offer has an imbalance of power in this process as they are the final decision maker on whether one's job search continues into the void or not. 

Again, this disparity is not intentional, and is derived from a large information asymmetry and communication deficit between the two parties, one which the Incentivize system once fully built out can massively reduce to the benefit of both parties.

Some such improvements to the current system could be:

- Fully detailed statistics on applicants during the application process that provides information on number of applicants, their specific experience and qualifications, percentages of applicants that have applied for and been hired that have similar qualifications to yours, etc. 

Even the above data could reduce the information assymetry between the two parties massively by lowering unrealistic expectations for applicants on certain jobs, as well as providing detailed at-a-glance statistics for job posters about potential candidates.
